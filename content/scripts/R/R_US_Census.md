# API Key Information

While an API key is not required to use the U.S. Census Data API, you
may consider registering for an API key as the API is limited to 500
calls a day without a key. Sign up can be found here:
https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html.

If using this code, make sure to access your key below.

Here we use ‘Sys.getenv()’ to retrieve our API key from the environment
variables. You can either do this by creating an [.Renviron file and
storing your API
Key](https://resources.numbat.space/using-rprofile-and-renviron.html) or
simply replacing “Sys.getenv(‘USCensusAPIKey’)” with your API Key.
`{r key, warning =FALSE, message = FALSE} # Access .Renviron to get PubMed API Key user_key = Sys.getenv('USCensusAPIKey')#use Sys.getenv() to access .Renviron`

# Setup censusapi Package

The package, censusapi, allows users to easily access U.S. Census data
and metadata, including datasets such as the Decennial Census, American
Community Survey, Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, Small Area
Income and Poverty Estimates, Population Estimates and Projections, and
more. In this tutorial, we will be using this censusapi.

If you haven’t already, run “install.packages(‘censusapi’)” in your R
Console to install the US Census API package we will be using for this
tutorial.

First let us set up the required library, “censusapi”.
`{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} library(censusapi) # Access censusapi library`
\# 1. Get Population Estimates of Counties by State

Our primary means of accessing the U.S. Census API will be through the
function “getCensus”. In this example we give specific comments as to
each line of code that should clarify each line.

In the following example we use arguments including ‘name’ and ‘vars’,
to access comprehensive lists of each see the censusapi documentation
located at the top of the article for further documentation on the
functions ‘listCensusApis()’ and ‘makeVarlist()’. \`\`\`{r PopEstCount,
message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} your_state_code = ‘01’ \# Alabama FIPS
Code

# Retrieve county population estimates by state

pop_estimates \<- getCensus(name = “acs/acs5/subject”, \#The
programmatic name of your dataset,See ‘listCensusApis()’ for options
vars = c(“NAME”, “S0101_C01_001E”), \#list of variables to get region =
“county:\*“, \#geography to get vintage =”2021”,#year key=user_key#API
key ) head(pop_estimates,n=10) \#Display first entries of
‘pop_estimates’


    The previous dataframe 'pop_estimates' gives counties from every state, given the wildcard, '*', in the 'region' argument. Now we want to filter the dataset so we are left with only Alabama. Additionally, the US Census API  utilizes codes for variables. To search for variables use the function 'makeVarlist()'; additional information on the usage can be found in the censusapi package documentation pdf file.

    ```{r popestcount 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    # Filter
    alabama_counties <- pop_estimates[pop_estimates$state == your_state_code,]

    # Extract population
    alabama_counties_populations <- data.frame(County = alabama_counties$NAME, Population = alabama_counties$S0101_C01_001E)

    # Print population
    head(alabama_counties_populations,n=10) #Display first entries of 'alabama_counties_populations'

Now we have successfully used the U.S. Census API to store population
estimates from Alabama counties in the variable
‘alabama_counties_populations’.

# 2. Get Population Estiamtes Over a Range of Years

We can use similar code as before, but we will loop through the
different population estimate datasets by year. \`\`\`{r PopEstRange,
message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} \# Define the range of years years \<-
c(2016:2021)

# Create an empty data frame to store the population estimates

pop_estimates_all \<- data.frame()

# Loop over the years

for (year in years) { \# Retrieve population estimates for Tuscaloosa
County pop_estimates \<- getCensus(name = “acs/acs5/subject”, vars =
c(“NAME”, “S0101_C01_001E”), region = “county:\*“, vintage =
as.character(year), key= user_key) alabama \<-
pop_estimates\[pop_estimates\$state == your_state_code,\]

\# Add the population estimate and year to the data frame
pop_estimates_all \<- rbind(pop_estimates_all, data.frame(Year = year,
Population = alabama$S0101_C01_001E,Name= alabama$NAME)) }

# Print the resulting data frame

head(pop_estimates_all,n=10)

    # 3. Plot Population Change

    We will use the data we retrieved in example 2 and then calculate and graph the percent change in population per county.
    ```{r PopChange, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    # Filter for the population in 2016
    pop_2016 <- pop_estimates_all[pop_estimates_all$Year == 2016, ]

    # Filter for the population in 2021
    pop_2021 <- pop_estimates_all[pop_estimates_all$Year == 2021, ]

    # Calculate the percent change in population
    pop_pct_change <- data.frame(County=pop_2021$Name,Pct_Change =round(((as.numeric( pop_2021$Population)-as.numeric(pop_2016$Population))/as.numeric(pop_2016$Population)),4)) # (pop_2021-pop_2016)/pop_2016 rounded to 5 digits

    # Next we're going to remove the 'County, Alabama' because it is repetitive.
    pop_pct_change[]<-lapply(pop_pct_change,function(x) (sub(' County, Alabama','',x)))

    head(pop_pct_change,n=10)

Next we will create a plot of the percent change in population by county
in Alabama from the years 2016 to 2021 using the package ggplot2.
\`\`\`{r plot popchg, message = FALSE, warning =FALSE} library(ggplot2)
\#library for creating graphics options(repr.plot.width = 100,
repr.plot.height =2) ggplot(pop_pct_change, aes(x =
reorder(pop_pct_change$County, as.numeric(pop_pct_change$Pct_Change)), y
= as.numeric(pop_pct_change\$Pct_Change))) + geom_point(orientation =
‘y’) + ylab(“Percent Change in Population”) + xlab(“AL County”) +
theme_bw()+ theme( panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x =
element_line(colour = “grey80”, linetype = “dashed”), axis.text.x =
element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust=.2, size= 7 ) )+
geom_hline(yintercept=0)+ ggtitle(“Percent Change in Population by
County from 2016 to 2021”)


    # R Session Info

    ```{r versions, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
    sessionInfo()
