## Chronicling Ameria API in R

By Cyrus Gomes, Vincent Scalfani, and Adam M. Nguyen

These recipe examples were tested on March 24, 2023.

**Documentation:**

[LOC Chronicling America API Documentation](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/)

See the bottom of the document for information on R and package versions.

**Attribution:** We thank Professor Jessica Kincaid (UA Libraries, Hoole Special Collections) for the use-cases. All data was collected from the Library of Congress, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers site, using the API.

Note that the data from the Alabama state intelligencer, The age-herald, and the Birmingham age-herald were contributed to Chronicling America by The University of Alabama Libraries: https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/awardees/au/


# Setup

First let us setup the required packages and base url for the Chronicling America API. If you have not already installed a package, run "install.packages('package name')", replacing 'package name' with the name of the package you require.


```r
library(tidyverse)  # ggplot2 & essential pacakges
library(dplyr)      # tibbles
library(purrr)      # turning into character
library(httr)       # GET()
library(jsonlite)   # converting to JSON
library(stringr)    # string removal
```

Setting the base url for the API:


```r
# First store string of the API's base url
base_url <- "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/"
```

# 1. Basic API request

The Chronicling America API identifies newspapers and other records using LCCNs. We can query the API once we have the LCCN for the newspaper and even ask for particular issues and editions. For example, the following link lists newspapers published in the state of Alabama, from which the LCCN can be obtained: https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/?state=Alabama

Here is an example with the Alabama State Intelligencer:


```r
# Below we will show a basic API call step by step
requested_url <- paste0(base_url, "lccn/sn84023600.json") # Concatenates stored api base url and the rest of our requested url
requested_url # Display requested_url
```

```
## [1] "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023600.json"
```

```r
# Retrieve raw Data from requested_url
raw_data <- GET(requested_url) # Retrieve data from url and presents user with information on the response
raw_data # Display response
```

```
## Response [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023600.json]
##   Date: 2023-03-24 19:26
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: application/json
##   Size: 334 B
```

```r
json_data <- rawToChar(raw_data$content) # Converts raw data to JSON format
json_data
```

```
## [1] "{\"place_of_publication\": \"Tuskaloosa [sic], Ala.\", \"lccn\": \"sn84023600\", \"start_year\": \"183?\", \"place\": [\"Alabama--Tuscaloosa--Tuscaloosa\"], \"name\": \"Alabama State intelligencer. [volume]\", \"publisher\": \"T.M. Bradford\", \"url\": \"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023600.json\", \"end_year\": \"18??\", \"issues\": [], \"subject\": []}"
```

```r
data <- fromJSON(json_data) # Converts to usable format
          
data             
```

```
## $place_of_publication
## [1] "Tuskaloosa [sic], Ala."
## 
## $lccn
## [1] "sn84023600"
## 
## $start_year

## 
## $end_year
## [1] "18??"
## 
## $issues
## list()
## 
## $subject
## list()
```

Indexing into the json output allows data to be extracted using key names as demonstrated below:


```r
data$name                
```

```
## [1] "Alabama State intelligencer. [volume]"
```


```r
data$publisher                  
```

```
## [1] "T.M. Bradford"
```


Moving on to another publication, we can get the 182nd page (seq-182) of the Evening Star newspaper published on November 19, 1961.


```r
data <- fromJSON(rawToChar(GET(paste(base_url, "lccn/sn83045462/1961-11-19/ed-1/seq-182.json", sep=""))$content), flatten = TRUE)
# Outputs a list of links in various formats

# 2. Frequency of “University of Alabama” mentions

For this next example, querying the API is relatively the same process, therefore we will follow the same steps. Feel free to refer to example 1 for information on a step-by-step basis.


```r

There are a lot of unreadable characters, and this text is hard to read. Let us simplify it. There is a lot of text here along with random characters and non-interpretable characters. Our approach here to get some of the titles will be to only keep uppercase letters and lines that are at least 75% letters 


```r
# We first remove all chars other than capital letters, newlines, and spaces
string_alpha<-gsub("[^A-Z\n ]", " ", request) 

# Display string_alpha
string_alpha

From what we see, we can still do better.

```r
# Iterate through split strings using function 'str_split()' as a means to split string_alpha by '\n'

for (k in str_split(string_alpha, "\n")){
  strings <- k # Number of Strings
  # We then store the number of spaces, size and actual letters we need in a list
  spaces <- lengths(regmatches(k, gregexpr(" ", k))) # Find number of spaces in each string
  head(spaces, n=5)
  size <- nchar(k) # Find overall number of characters in string
  letters <- size-spaces # Find number of  letters in string
}
```


```r
# Iterate through strings to produce strings we want to see
for (i in 1:length(strings)){
  if (is.na(letters[i]/size[i])){
  }
  else if((letters[i]/size[i])>=0.75){  #Set limitations and print the characters that we want to see
    cat(strings[i])
    cat("\n")
  }
}
